        tip9: `Via covered with soldermask. Hole may or may not be filled. `,
        tip10: `Via filled with soldermask ink.`,
        tip11: `Via filled with soldermask ink.`,
        tip12: `Gerber files: Soldermask layer applies, selection ignored.`,
        tip13: `Gerber files: Soldermask layer applies, selection ignored.`,
        tip14: `Gerber files: Leave a note explaining which vias to plug. `,
        tip15: `Quality Standard`,
        tip16: `No soldermask on the via hole or annular ring. Solder should wet the annular ring.`,
        tip17: `Solder should not wet or adhere to the via.`,
        tip18: `The soldermask should cover the colour of copper in at least 95% of the vias. Solder should not wet or adhere to the via. Vias should have 95% opacity.`,
        tip19: `Notes`,
        tip20: `Vias holes larger than 0.5 mm may have solder remaining within.`,
        tip21: `The soldermask over tented vias can be thinner than on the rest of the board and this can cause the colour of copper to show through.`,
        tip22: `Not available for vias without soldermask, via-in-pad, or vias closer than 0.35 mm from another soldermask opening. On multilayer boards, choose epoxy filling instead.`,
        tip23: `Finish Type`,
        tip24: `Plugged`,
        tip25: `Epoxy-Filled and Plated Over`,
        tip26: `Photo`,
        tip27: `Process`,
        tip28: `Via holes are filled with solder resist and are opaque`,
        tip29: `Via holes are filled with epoxy (conductive or non-conductive) and are opaque`,
        tip30: `Pros`,
        tip31: `Low-cost and simple to manufacture`,
        tip32: `Flat surface; no requirement on via placement`,
        tip33: `Cons`,
        tip34: `The filling can contain air bubbles, causing an uneven surface. Vias have to be soldermask-covered and no less than 0.35 mm from any other soldermask opening`,
        tip35: `Costly and complex to produce`,
        tip36: `Untented Vias`,
        tip37: `This option removes soldermask over all vias, exposing them to the same surface finish as all other exposed copper such as solder pads. Available surface finishes include HASL and ENIG.`,
        tip38: `Quality standard: vias should be wettable both in wave soldering and with a soldering iron.`,
        tip39: `Important Notes`,
        tip40: `Vias are treated differently from pads (through-holes where components are installed), and the via finish option does not apply to pads. Vias don’t have a specified tolerance whereas pad through-holes are +0.13/–0.08 mm. Vias should not be used to hold components; pads should be used instead.`,
        tip41: `To avoid shorts during HASL, bare vias should be spaced at least 0.2 mm away from other exposed copper. To achieve clearances lower than 0.2 mm, use ENIG instead of HASL.`,
        tip42: `Tented Vias`,
        tip43: `This option is the most commonly used. Vias are covered with soldermask, and surface finish such as HASL is not applied to vias.`,
        tip44: `Quality standard: Solder should not adhere to vias, either in wave soldering or with a soldering iron.`,
        tip45: `Important Notes`,
        tip46: `Vias holes should ideally be 0.4 mm or less and no larger than 0.5 mm if permitted by routing and current-carrying requirements. Larger vias are not guaranteed to be fully covered; no complaints are accepted regarding this type of defect.`,
        tip47: `Why some tented vias appear yellow/brown: solder-resist is applied as a liquid and levelled by heating the board in an oven allowing the liquid to flow. During this process, the solder-resist can flow down the via hole, leaving a thinner layer on the annular ring than in other parts of the board. This allows the colour of the copper underneath to show through, making the vias look yellow/brown. This is a normal consequence of tenting vias.`,
        tip48: `Plugged Vias`,
        tip49: `Vias are filled with solder-resist before the whole board is printed with soldermask. This makes sure vias don’t appear yellow as they do when tented.`,
        tip50: `Quality standard: The soldermask should cover the colour of copper in at least 95% of the vias. Solder should not wet or adhere to the via. Vias should have 95% opacity.`,
        tip51: `Epoxy-Filled & Capped Vias`,
        tip52: `Vias are filled with non-conductive epoxy resin, and then plated over with copper. Soldermask over the via is not required.`,
        tip53: `Quality standard: Vias should be completely opaque. Vias with soldermask can be printed over with silkscreen; those without soldermask should have the same surface finish (HASL / ENIG) as other exposed copper.`,
        tip54: `Copper-Epoxy-Filled & Capped Vias`,
        tip55: `Vias are filled with conductive epoxy resin containing copper, and then plated over with copper. Soldermask over the via is not required.`,
        tip56: `Quality standard: Vias should be completely opaque. Vias with soldermask can be printed over with silkscreen; those without soldermask should have the same surface finish (HASL / ENIG) as other exposed copper. This type of epoxy has an excellent thermal conductivity of 8 W/(m⋅K).`,
        tip57: `Important Notes`,
        tip58: `Plugged and epoxy-filled vias holes should not be larger than 0.5 mm as larger holes may be incompletely filled. No complaints are accepted for this problem.`,
        tip59: `For epoxy-filled vias, please leave a note or upload an image along with your design files to explain which vias should be filled. Alternatively, you can specify to fill all vias of a particular diameter.`,
        tip60: `For plugged vias, original CAD files are preferred over Gerber files as this lets us know which holes are vias and which are solderable through-holes. If you do upload Gerber files, please attach an image highlighting which vias should be plugged, and leave a note to specify which via diameters should be plugged. We recommend you select “Confirm production files” so that you can check the via finish is correct before the board goes to production.`,
        tip61: `FPC imposition does not support stamps and V-CUT process, only need to design the connecting bridge.`,
        tip62: `FPC design requirements are as follows:`,
        tip63: `1. Imposition spacing: the spacing between panels is generally 2mm, and the spacing with steel sheet reinforcement is recommended to be 3mm;`,
        tip64: `2. Craft edge design:`,
        tip65: `The process edge width is 5mm, and it needs to be added on all four sides;`,
        tip66: `Copper needs to be covered on the process edge, and the distance between the copper skin and the light spot opening and positioning hole should be more than 0.5mm;`,
        tip67: `Four positioning holes with a diameter of 2mm are added on the process edge, and one of them needs to be staggered by 5mm for error prevention;`,
        tip68: `Four SMT optical dots with a diameter of 1mm are added, and the center of the optical dot is 3.85mm from the edge of the board. One of them needs to be staggered by 5mm for error prevention.`,
        tip69: `3. The length of the connecting bridge is 0.7-1.0mm, and the connecting bridge in the steel sheet reinforcement area should be 1mm as much as possible, and the bridge should be increased appropriately to prevent the expansion and contraction deformation of the FPC caused by the excessive weight of the steel sheet, which will affect the subsequent SMT;`,
        tip70: `4. The maximum size of imposition is 250X500mm, and the minimum size is 70*70mm;`,
        tip71: `5. Optical points of SMT bad boards: For boards that need to be patched, optical points of bad boards need to be added next to each small board. When the small board FPC production is scrapped, the board factory will blacken the corresponding optical points, and the placement machine After identification, there will be no packaging, saving costs;`,
        tip72: `6. Steel sheet reinforcement imposition: The distance between the steel sheet reinforcement position plate and the plate should be more than 3mm; the steel sheet area needs to be grooved around the plate, and the width is 0.8mm, which is convenient for laser forming.`,
        tip73: `7. During mass production, the utilization rate of the board must be considered in the imposition, otherwise the price will be relatively high, and the width is designed to be within 119mm. In addition, the board size of the line width and line spacing below 3mil cannot be too large. `,
        tip74: `Edge plating`,
        tip75: `, also referred to as side plating or castellation, is a specialized technique employed in PCB manufacturing to enhance the durability and protection of the circuit board's edges. At PCBSUPER, we utilize the ENIG surface treatment method for side plating. `,
        tip76: `Here are the corresponding instructions for your reference:`,
        tip77: `1. Ifplated edges are required, supply an annotated diagram showing which edges to plate, select the plated edges option when ordering, and describe in the order notes.`,
        tip78: `2. Order note example: 'Plate the edges circled in red in the diagram.'`,
        tip79: `3. Selective edge plating can be applied to the walls of large rectangular slots, as indicated by the blue and red arrows in the diagram above.`,
        tip80: `4. Selective edge plating can be applied to pads surrounding rectangular slots if the pads have at least 2mm spacing, as indicated in purple above.`,
        tip81: `5. Ifall four edges of the PCB are plated, 3 to 4 short segments (at least 2mm spacing) must be left unplated to allow for panel support tabs, for example at the positions marked A, B, C, and D above.`,
        tip82: `As required by the relevant US State Sales Tax Laws, the marketplace facilitator is required to collect Sales Tax and remit to the relevant tax authorities. Items sold on PCBSUPER.com and shipped to locations both inside and outside the US, including territories, may be subject to tax.`,
        tip83: `How is Tax calculated?`,
        tip84: `The amount of tax charged on your order depends on several factors including the following:`,
        tip85: `· The type of item or service purchased`,
        tip86: `· The time and location of fulfillment`,
        tip87: `· The shipment or delivery address of your order`,
        tip88: `These factors may change between the time you place an order and when your shipment is complete. As a result, the tax calculated on your order may change. We display an estimated "Sales Tax" to be collected at Check Out when confirming an order. This estimated tax may then be updated later when your order is finalized and completed.`,
        tip89: `The tax rate applied to your order will be the combined state and local rates of the address where your order is delivered to or fulfilled from. For example, if you live in a state that does not impose a sales tax, you may still see tax calculated on your order if shipped to another state. Moreover, the tax rates applied to your order may also be different for a variety of reasons, such as residential versus business addresses. Also, the total selling price of an item will generally include item-level shipping and handling charges, item level discounts, and gift wrapping charges. Sale tax will be calculated based on the total amount.`,
        tip90: `Can sales tax get exempt?`,
        tip91: `Sales tax is charged on shipments in most states that have a sales tax, unless you are sales tax exempt and we have your exemption certificate. If you are exempt from paying sales tax at the time of purchase, you must provide a valid sales tax exemption certificate and number, if applicable, for the state you are shipping to. We will not refund sales tax amounts collected in the event when a valid certificate is not provided. If you provide a certificate that is not accepted for any reason by any governmental or regulatory authority, and PCBSUPER is required to pay tax on your purchase, you will reimburse PCBSUPER for the amount of such tax, and PCBSUPER's reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the payment and collection of such tax. `,
        tip92: `Upload your exemption certificate when it comes to checkout page. Your information and certificate uploaded will be verified by our system automatically, if automative verification is unsuccessful, manual verification may take us 1-2 days to check.`,
        tip93: `For Registered PCBSUPER Customers Exempt From Sales Tax: Your online order will not reflect any company exemption already on file, if applicable, unless you are logged into your registered account.`,

        tip150: `1. Why PCBSUPER (an international seller) who has no physical presence in the U.S. has an obligation to collect sales tax from the U.S. buyers?`,
        tip151: `A June 21, 2018 Supreme Court of the United States case allowed states to require online sellers with “economic nexus” in their state to comply with that state’s sales tax requirements.`,
        tip152: `This simply means that if a seller - no matter where they are located - makes a certain dollar amount of sales in a state, or a certain number of transactions with buyers in that state, then they are required to collect sales tax in that state if their sales volume exceeds the threshold specified by related states.`,
        tip153: `For example, in Kentucky, any seller (U.S. based or international) who makes more than $100,000 in sales in the state in the previous or current calendar year, or who made more than 200 sales transactions in the state in the previous or current calendar year, is required to comply with Kentucky’s sales tax laws. Compliance means registering for a Kentucky sales tax permit and collecting sales tax from any buyers in Kentucky.`,
        tip154: `2. Why is PCBSUPER required to collect sales tax in your state now, but was not required to do so in the past?`,

        tip456: `(1) If gold fingers have copper on the back: Subtract one layer of coverlay thickness (since gold fingers do not have cover film, this thickness needs to be subtracted).`,
        tip457: `(2) If gold fingers have no copper on the back: Subtract one layer of coverlay thickness and then subtract one layer of copper thickness (as gold fingers have no copper on the back, this additional copper layer needs to be subtracted).`,
        tip458: `For example:`,
        tip459: `if the total thickness in the gold finger area is 0.3 mm, the board thickness is 0.11 mm, and there is no copper on the back of the gold fingers, the theoretical thickness of the PI stiffener would be calculated as follows`,
        tip460: `PI Thickness = 0.3 - (0.11 - 0.0275 - 0.012) = 0.2295 mm. In this case, you should choose a PI thickness of 0.25 mm.`,

        tip166: `● In compliance with international trade principles, product descriptions need to be provided for customs clearance.`,
        tip167: `● Please select the correct product description. When there is no choice matched, select "other", and fill in a clear and accurate description.`,
        tip168: `Please keep in mind:`,
        tip169: `1. There might be import duties&taxes, the applicable rate of customs duties&taxes varies depending on the description of the goods and the import regulations of different countries.`,
        tip170: `2. Shipments with vague descriptions might be held or delayed by customs. Customers will take responsibility for customs penalties caused by wrong information provided.`,
        tip171: `3. Generally we don't change the product description provided, however, we modify it when it doesn't match the exact product.`,
        tip172: `X-Out board stands for the defective boards in PCB panels, and X marks are usually marked on both the top and bottom sides. Please note that extra work may occur for assembly when handling the x-outs boards.`,
        tip173: `If you allow the X-out boards to exist in PCB panels, a damaged printed circuit board (according to E-test) is not removed from the panel, but marked (X-out) and the whole panel will deliver to you.`,
        tip174: `If you do not want a panel with X-out boards, select the "Not Accept"option. Additional costs may be incurred as the production cost increases when reproducing the whole panel.`,
        tip175: `Step stencils provide different volume of solder paste for the electronic assemblies whose components require different amount of solder paste on the one PCB during stencil printing. Currently we only provide two levels of stencil thickness.`,
        tip176: `Please make sure your PCB size is within the valid area.`,
        tip177: `Valid Area`,
        tip178: `The quantity of stencils required.`,
        tip179: `Sanding: Polishing the stencil surface with sandpaper, which can satisfy general needs.`,
        tip180: `Etching: The etching polishing is an economical option. The stencil can be easily polished and deburred by etching process. It has light surface scratches and solder paste may remain on the surface.`,
        tip181: `Electropolishing: Electropolishing is the electrochemical process to remove the metallic material from the workpiece, in order to obtain a smoother metal surface.`,
        tip182: `Etching polishing is recommended for boards with BGAs or ICs with pitch equal to or less than 0.5mm.`,
        tip183: `Fiducial Mark is an alignment mark for surface mount assembly machines.In General,machine assembly must have Fiducial marks.Fiducial marks are unnecessary when you are placing your parts by hand.`,
        tip184: `PCBSUPER engineers will create the production file required to manufacture the PCB. If you choose "Yes", you will be able to check and confirm it before production. A notification email will be sent to you when the production file is completed.`,
        tip185: `If you want any specific text(e.g. To identify different stencils) to be printed on the stencil, please select "Yes" and add your requirements in the remark section. If you select "Yes" but don't provide any text, then the file name and order # will be printed on the stencil, as shown below.`,
        tip186: `The PCBSUPER logo is printed on the package box by default. Please select the "Blank box" option if you don't want the logo printed.`,
        tip187: `Which side should the step areas be. The squeegee side is where the solder paste applies. The board side is the stencil side sticked to the PCB board.`,
        tip188: `Specify desired thickness for step areas. Step thickness must be between 0.06 - 0.3mm.`,
        tip189: `The thickness of other areas, expect the step areas.`,
        tip190: `Which component pads(designators) should be in step areas on the stencil.`,
        tip191: `Commonly used on FPCs with gold finger connectors. A deep-brown polyimide layer is attached to the back of the gold fingers.`,
        tip192: `FR4 is often used on low-cost products to support component placement. Some dust may remain from cutting the FR4.`,
        tip193: `Stainless steel stiffeners have excellent flatness and rigidity and are often used to support SMD component placement.`,
        tip194: `Flexible PCBs with 3M9077 adhesive tape can be used in the lead-free soldering process (peak temperature 260°C, ≤ 20 sec.). The protective cover remains largely undamaged and can be easily removed. The low outgassing of the adhesive reduces the contamination of electronic components. Please note that 3M468 and 3M467 cannot be used in the lead-free soldering process.`,
        tip195: `The total thickness at the gold finger area, it refers to the combined thickness of the FPC and the PI stiffener. This total thickness isn't simply additive; coverlay and copper thickness also need to be considered.`,
        tip196: `For more……`,
