        tip1: `When ordering a PCB there are generally five via covering options available: Tented, Untented, Plugged, Epoxy-filled & Capped, and Copper-epoxy-filled & Capped.`,
        tip2: `Finish Type`,
        tip3: `Untented`,
        tip4: `Tented`,
        tip5: `Plugged`,
        tip6: `Appearance`,
        tip7: `Process`,
        tip8: `Same as all other exposed copper (HASL or ENIG).`,
        tip9: `Via covered with soldermask. Hole may or may not be filled. `,
        tip10: `Via filled with soldermask ink.`,
        tip11: `Via filled with soldermask ink.`,
        tip12: `Gerber files: Soldermask layer applies, selection ignored.`,
        tip13: `Gerber files: Soldermask layer applies, selection ignored.`,
        tip14: `Gerber files: Leave a note explaining which vias to plug. `,
        tip15: `Quality Standard`,
        tip16: `No soldermask on the via hole or annular ring. Solder should wet the annular ring.`,
        tip17: `Solder should not wet or adhere to the via.`,
        tip18: `The soldermask should cover the colour of copper in at least 95% of the vias. Solder should not wet or adhere to the via. Vias should have 95% opacity.`,
        tip19: `Notes`,
        tip20: `Vias holes larger than 0.5 mm may have solder remaining within.`,
        tip21: `The soldermask over tented vias can be thinner than on the rest of the board and this can cause the colour of copper to show through.`,
        tip22: `Not available for vias without soldermask, via-in-pad, or vias closer than 0.35 mm from another soldermask opening. On multilayer boards, choose epoxy filling instead.`,
        tip23: `Finish Type`,
        tip24: `Plugged`,
        tip25: `Epoxy-Filled and Plated Over`,
        tip26: `Photo`,
        tip27: `Process`,
        tip28: `Via holes are filled with solder resist and are opaque`,
        tip29: `Via holes are filled with epoxy (conductive or non-conductive) and are opaque`,
        tip30: `Pros`,
        tip31: `Low-cost and simple to manufacture`,
        tip32: `Flat surface; no requirement on via placement`,
        tip33: `Cons`,
        tip34: `The filling can contain air bubbles, causing an uneven surface. Vias have to be soldermask-covered and no less than 0.35 mm from any other soldermask opening`,
        tip35: `Costly and complex to produce`,
        tip36: `Untented Vias`,
        tip37: `This option removes soldermask over all vias, exposing them to the same surface finish as all other exposed copper such as solder pads. Available surface finishes include HASL and ENIG.`,
        tip38: `Quality standard: vias should be wettable both in wave soldering and with a soldering iron.`,
        tip39: `Important Notes`,
        tip40: `Vias are treated differently from pads (through-holes where components are installed), and the via finish option does not apply to pads. Vias don’t have a specified tolerance whereas pad through-holes are +0.13/–0.08 mm. Vias should not be used to hold components; pads should be used instead.`,
        tip41: `To avoid shorts during HASL, bare vias should be spaced at least 0.2 mm away from other exposed copper. To achieve clearances lower than 0.2 mm, use ENIG instead of HASL.`,
        tip42: `Tented Vias`,
        tip43: `This option is the most commonly used. Vias are covered with soldermask, and surface finish such as HASL is not applied to vias.`,
        tip44: `Quality standard: Solder should not adhere to vias, either in wave soldering or with a soldering iron.`,
        tip45: `Important Notes`,
        tip46: `Vias holes should ideally be 0.4 mm or less and no larger than 0.5 mm if permitted by routing and current-carrying requirements. Larger vias are not guaranteed to be fully covered; no complaints are accepted regarding this type of defect.`,
        tip47: `Why some tented vias appear yellow/brown: solder-resist is applied as a liquid and levelled by heating the board in an oven allowing the liquid to flow. During this process, the solder-resist can flow down the via hole, leaving a thinner layer on the annular ring than in other parts of the board. This allows the colour of the copper underneath to show through, making the vias look yellow/brown. This is a normal consequence of tenting vias.`,
        tip48: `Plugged Vias`,
        tip49: `Vias are filled with solder-resist before the whole board is printed with soldermask. This makes sure vias don’t appear yellow as they do when tented.`,
        tip50: `Quality standard: The soldermask should cover the colour of copper in at least 95% of the vias. Solder should not wet or adhere to the via. Vias should have 95% opacity.`,
        tip51: `Epoxy-Filled & Capped Vias`,
        tip52: `Vias are filled with non-conductive epoxy resin, and then plated over with copper. Soldermask over the via is not required.`,
        tip53: `Quality standard: Vias should be completely opaque. Vias with soldermask can be printed over with silkscreen; those without soldermask should have the same surface finish (HASL / ENIG) as other exposed copper.`,
        tip54: `Copper-Epoxy-Filled & Capped Vias`,
        tip55: `Vias are filled with conductive epoxy resin containing copper, and then plated over with copper. Soldermask over the via is not required.`,
        tip56: `Quality standard: Vias should be completely opaque. Vias with soldermask can be printed over with silkscreen; those without soldermask should have the same surface finish (HASL / ENIG) as other exposed copper. This type of epoxy has an excellent thermal conductivity of 8 W/(m⋅K).`,
        tip57: `Important Notes`,
        tip58: `Plugged and epoxy-filled vias holes should not be larger than 0.5 mm as larger holes may be incompletely filled. No complaints are accepted for this problem.`,
        tip59: `For epoxy-filled vias, please leave a note or upload an image along with your design files to explain which vias should be filled. Alternatively, you can specify to fill all vias of a particular diameter.`,
        tip60: `For plugged vias, original CAD files are preferred over Gerber files as this lets us know which holes are vias and which are solderable through-holes. If you do upload Gerber files, please attach an image highlighting which vias should be plugged, and leave a note to specify which via diameters should be plugged. We recommend you select “Confirm production files” so that you can check the via finish is correct before the board goes to production.`,
        tip61: `FPC imposition does not support stamps and V-CUT process, only need to design the connecting bridge.`,
        tip62: `FPC design requirements are as follows:`,
        tip63: `1. Imposition spacing: the spacing between panels is generally 2mm, and the spacing with steel sheet reinforcement is recommended to be 3mm;`,
        tip64: `2. Craft edge design:`,
        tip65: `The process edge width is 5mm, and it needs to be added on all four sides;`,
        tip66: `Copper needs to be covered on the process edge, and the distance between the copper skin and the light spot opening and positioning hole should be more than 0.5mm;`,
        tip67: `Four positioning holes with a diameter of 2mm are added on the process edge, and one of them needs to be staggered by 5mm for error prevention;`,
        tip68: `Four SMT optical dots with a diameter of 1mm are added, and the center of the optical dot is 3.85mm from the edge of the board. One of them needs to be staggered by 5mm for error prevention.`,
        tip69: `3. The length of the connecting bridge is 0.7-1.0mm, and the connecting bridge in the steel sheet reinforcement area should be 1mm as much as possible, and the bridge should be increased appropriately to prevent the expansion and contraction deformation of the FPC caused by the excessive weight of the steel sheet, which will affect the subsequent SMT;`,
        tip70: `4. The maximum size of imposition is 250X500mm, and the minimum size is 70*70mm;`,
        tip71: `5. Optical points of SMT bad boards: For boards that need to be patched, optical points of bad boards need to be added next to each small board. When the small board FPC production is scrapped, the board factory will blacken the corresponding optical points, and the placement machine After identification, there will be no packaging, saving costs;`,
        tip72: `6. Steel sheet reinforcement imposition: The distance between the steel sheet reinforcement position plate and the plate should be more than 3mm; the steel sheet area needs to be grooved around the plate, and the width is 0.8mm, which is convenient for laser forming.`,
        tip73: `7. During mass production, the utilization rate of the board must be considered in the imposition, otherwise the price will be relatively high, and the width is designed to be within 119mm. In addition, the board size of the line width and line spacing below 3mil cannot be too large. `,
        tip74: `Edge plating`,
        tip75: `, also referred to as side plating or castellation, is a specialized technique employed in PCB manufacturing to enhance the durability and protection of the circuit board's edges. At PCBSUPER, we utilize the ENIG surface treatment method for side plating. `,
        tip76: `Here are the corresponding instructions for your reference:`,
        tip77: `1. Ifplated edges are required, supply an annotated diagram showing which edges to plate, select the plated edges option when ordering, and describe in the order notes.`,
        tip78: `2. Order note example: 'Plate the edges circled in red in the diagram.'`,
        tip79: `3. Selective edge plating can be applied to the walls of large rectangular slots, as indicated by the blue and red arrows in the diagram above.`,
        tip80: `4. Selective edge plating can be applied to pads surrounding rectangular slots if the pads have at least 2mm spacing, as indicated in purple above.`,
        tip81: `5. Ifall four edges of the PCB are plated, 3 to 4 short segments (at least 2mm spacing) must be left unplated to allow for panel support tabs, for example at the positions marked A, B, C, and D above.`,
        tip82: `As required by the relevant US State Sales Tax Laws, the marketplace facilitator is required to collect Sales Tax and remit to the relevant tax authorities. Items sold on PCBSUPER.com and shipped to locations both inside and outside the US, including territories, may be subject to tax.`,
        tip83: `How is Tax calculated?`,
        tip84: `The amount of tax charged on your order depends on several factors including the following:`,
        tip85: `· The type of item or service purchased`,
        tip86: `· The time and location of fulfillment`,
        tip87: `· The shipment or delivery address of your order`,
        tip88: `These factors may change between the time you place an order and when your shipment is complete. As a result, the tax calculated on your order may change. We display an estimated "Sales Tax" to be collected at Check Out when confirming an order. This estimated tax may then be updated later when your order is finalized and completed.`,
        tip89: `The tax rate applied to your order will be the combined state and local rates of the address where your order is delivered to or fulfilled from. For example, if you live in a state that does not impose a sales tax, you may still see tax calculated on your order if shipped to another state. Moreover, the tax rates applied to your order may also be different for a variety of reasons, such as residential versus business addresses. Also, the total selling price of an item will generally include item-level shipping and handling charges, item level discounts, and gift wrapping charges. Sale tax will be calculated based on the total amount.`,
        tip90: `Can sales tax get exempt?`,
        tip91: `Sales tax is charged on shipments in most states that have a sales tax, unless you are sales tax exempt and we have your exemption certificate. If you are exempt from paying sales tax at the time of purchase, you must provide a valid sales tax exemption certificate and number, if applicable, for the state you are shipping to. We will not refund sales tax amounts collected in the event when a valid certificate is not provided. If you provide a certificate that is not accepted for any reason by any governmental or regulatory authority, and PCBSUPER is required to pay tax on your purchase, you will reimburse PCBSUPER for the amount of such tax, and PCBSUPER's reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the payment and collection of such tax. `,
        tip92: `Upload your exemption certificate when it comes to checkout page. Your information and certificate uploaded will be verified by our system automatically, if automative verification is unsuccessful, manual verification may take us 1-2 days to check.`,
        tip93: `For Registered PCBSUPER Customers Exempt From Sales Tax: Your online order will not reflect any company exemption already on file, if applicable, unless you are logged into your registered account.`,
        tip94: `Seller information for exemption certificate form filling：`,
        tip95: `Seller：AMERICA PCBSUPER INDUSTRY LIMITED`,
        tip96: `Address：18th Floor, An Kang Commercial Building, 145 Hennessy Road, Wan Chai, Hong Kong`,
        tip97: `If there is any problem related, feel free to contact with market{'@'}pcbsuper.com. `,
        tip98: `Note:`,
        tip99: `· You're acknowledging that the tax exemption information entered is correct and the tax-exempt organization is recognized as valid by the state or US territory in which you've enrolled, customer will be responsible for tax authorities punishment due to providing wrong or deceptive exemption information.`,

        tip149: `FAQs`,
        tip150: `1. Why PCBSUPER (an international seller) who has no physical presence in the U.S. has an obligation to collect sales tax from the U.S. buyers?`,
        tip151: `A June 21, 2018 Supreme Court of the United States case allowed states to require online sellers with “economic nexus” in their state to comply with that state’s sales tax requirements.`,
        tip152: `This simply means that if a seller - no matter where they are located - makes a certain dollar amount of sales in a state, or a certain number of transactions with buyers in that state, then they are required to collect sales tax in that state if their sales volume exceeds the threshold specified by related states.`,
        tip153: `For example, in Kentucky, any seller (U.S. based or international) who makes more than $100,000 in sales in the state in the previous or current calendar year, or who made more than 200 sales transactions in the state in the previous or current calendar year, is required to comply with Kentucky’s sales tax laws. Compliance means registering for a Kentucky sales tax permit and collecting sales tax from any buyers in Kentucky.`,
        tip154: `2. Why is PCBSUPER required to collect sales tax in your state now, but was not required to do so in the past?`,
        tip155: `According to the tax regulations of U.S. states, sales tax only starts to be charged when the sales amount of a company has reached a certain threshold. `,
        tip156: `The sales tax will be charged by the seller on behalf of the local state tax authority, and declared and submitted to the tax authority on a monthly basis. `,
        tip157: `PCBSUPER made the decision to register and begin to charge sales tax in U.S. states due to the growth and anticipated growth of our business.`,
        tip158: `3. How to use Sales tax exemption certificate and where can I aquire it?`,
        tip159: `If you own a sales tax exemption certificate and upload it when you order on our website, you may get exempted from the sales tax directly. Of course, the certificate has to be valid, which will be checked by our system after you upload.`,
        tip160: `The sales tax exemption certificate is issued by the tax authority of the local state. You may consult your tax accountant or local tax authority about if you are qualified to apply for an exemption certificate and how to acquire this certificate.`,
        tip161: `The recipient of an international shipment may be subject to import taxes, customs duties and fees, which are levied once a shipment reaches the recipient's country. All duties and taxes for international shipments are the responsibility of the customer. PCBSUPER is not responsible for any extra charges once the original package has been shipped. PCBSUPER has no control over these charges, nor can PCBSUPER predict what they may be.`,
        tip162: `Every country has a tax threshold, which is the amount where a person begins paying taxes on an item. Custom duty may not apply to every international shipment. Below are import tax thresholds for some countries, the info is for reference only.`,

        tip187: `Note:`,
        tip188: `ustoms offices in some countries or regions require the importer of record to provide a particular form of identification before releasing a shipment. You may be required to provide an identification number such as a Unique Identification Number, CPF, or Tax ID.`,
        tip189: `Countries/regions that require an identification number include: India, Brazil, Turkey, South Korea, Chile, Ecuador, Israel, Peru, Qatar, and South Africa.`,

        tip191: `What is EU VAT reform about?`,
        tip192: `1. From 1 July 2021, the VAT exemption for the importation of goods into the EU with a value not exceeding EUR 22 will be removed. And all goods imported into the EU will be subject to VAT.`,
        tip193: `2. A new special scheme for distance sales of business-to-consumer (B2C) goods imported from third territories or third countries of an intrinsic value not exceeding EUR 150 will be created and is referred to as the Import One Stop Shop (IOSS). If IOSS is used, VAT is not paid at the time of importation of eligible goods into the EU. VAT is paid by the customer as part of the purchase price (at check-out point).`,
        tip194: `3. The customs duty relief for goods with an intrinsic value not exceeding EUR 150 imported into the EU27 remains in place. That means that no customs duty has to be paid for goods in a consignment imported into the EU whose intrinsic value does not exceed EUR 150.`,
        tip195: `4. Import of goods with an intrinsic value of more than EUR 150 will still be operated in accordance with the previous import customs clearance mode.`,
        tip196: `5. VAT exemption before and after 1 July 2021`,
        tip197: `Source of the Explanatory Notes and Guides： https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/business/vat/vat-e-commerce_en`,
        tip198: `What will PCBSUPER react to EU VAT reform?`,

        tip399: `1. Notes on DFM`,
        tip400: `1.The design of the PCB footprints must comply with "medium density" or "low density" standards listed in IPC-7351B. High density is not supported.`,
        tip401: `2.The placement and gap of the components must comply with "medium density" or "low density" standards listed in IPC-7351B. For example, components overlap or components with very small gap should be avoided.`,
        tip402: `3. The distance between the body of the components and the edge of the board must be equal or greater than 2.5mm.`,
        tip403: `4. The 10-zone reflow oven is used in the SMT line. As thermal conductivity is inconsistent for different PCB pads,if thermal design is not considered, tomb-stone, displacement and other defects may occur.`,
        tip404: `5. Board warping may occur during reflow processing, the warpage can be reduced if thermal capacity has been considered in the design. For example: the balance of the copper density and distribution for each layer will affect the warpage.`,
        tip405: `6. For SMD parts, please check the placement and polarity in 2D production file. For through-hole parts, please check the placement in 3D production file. Customers are suggested to check the production file in Order history in time. If there is anything should be modified, contact Support Team in time.`,
        tip406: `2. Quality Assurance`,
        tip407: `1. Designs that comply with the industrial standard will have a higher yield.`,
        tip408: `2. We promise the yield of the soldering joints is greater than 95% if the design complies with the industrial standard.`,
        tip409: `3. We will not do a power-on test for all boards. Components' functionality will also not be tested.`,
        tip410: `3. Exception Handling during Assembly Production`,
        tip411: `1. A component may be missed (unpopulated) because of the inventory mismatching or pick and place machine mulfunction, PCBSUPER will refund the relevant cost(the cost of the unpopulated parts, soldering joints points, cost for extended components), PCBSUPER will not take the consequential responsibility caused by this issue.`,
        tip412: `2. If the component in the BOM does not match the footprint, this part will not be populated. PCBSUPER will not take the consequential responsibility caused by this problem.`,
        tip413: `3. We use no- clean solder paste, so by default we do not wash the boards after soldering is complete. If you have strict requirements for this and need us to provide board cleaning services, please contact Support after placing your order.`,
        tip414: `4. We recommend that customers check all order information carefully when placing an order. Secondary processing is not recommended. If you really need it, please understand that there will be some risk since the secondary processing is all carried out manually.`,
        tip415: `4. Disclaimer`,
        tip416: `1. Please make sure you've provided accurate data when you place the order. When the order has been submitted successfully, the SMT line starts to process the order according to the data you provided`,
        tip417: `2. The process from PCB to PCB assembly is a complex, multi-stage process, make the whole process error-free is almost impossible. For instance, issues might occur when producing PCBs and causing your order with missing quantity. The missing PCBs cannot be reproduced for PCBA orders currently, so only those good boards will be assembled. The difference for unassembled boards will be refunded. PCBSUPER will not take responsibility when the delivered quantity is less than the ordered quantity.`,
        tip418: `3. The PCBA order cannot be canceled once the PCB production has started.`,
        tip419: `4. For smoother fabrication, PCBSUPER sometimes updates the HASL-Leaded to lead-free HASL for assembly service, PCBSUPER bears the extra fee.`,
        tip420: `5. Tooling holes, Edge rails and Fiducials are required for PCB assembly orders. If you choose "Tooling Holes Added by Customer” and "Edge Rail/ Fiducials Added by Customer", but there are no tooling holes and edge rails/fiducial or incompatibility in your file, to avoid delays, we will help to add or modify them by default.`,
        tip421: `6. With via in pads there is the issue of having sufficient solderpasted to fill the via hole during the reflow process, which can cause a lot of problems, for instance, skewed parts, tombstoning, etc, PCBSUPER will not take the consequential responsibility due to this.`,
        tip422: `7. For Economic PCBA, orders from different customers are combined and produced together, including PCB, stencil and assembly. Therefore, when you place an order for five PCB and two PCBA, there is some possibility that the three blank boards are reflowed and covered with tin.`,
        tip423: `8. To avoid boards damage, PCBSUPER has regular packing method, which is decided after thorough evaluation and investigation in real production and transportation. If customers have their own requirements in packing, please contact us for further evaluation after placing the orders. If not, PCBSUPER will pack the boards in the regular packing method by default and if there is some damage to boards or parts in transit, PCBSUPER will not take the final responsibility.`,
        tip424: `9. When there are no abnormalities such as visible welding defects, but some or all of the boards do not work, we recommend that the customers verify the design problems first. There are many reasons for boards not working expectedly. In the absence of visible error, PCBSUPER will endeavor to assist the customers in investigating the cause of the defect, but PCBSUPER shall not be ultimately liable if it is not clearly stated that the defect is caused by PCBSUPER.`,
        tip425: `10. If many LEDs are used on customer's boards, we suggest customers contact us for function tests after the assembly is complete, so we can communicate and solve the problem before shipping and avoid wasting time and money after customers receive the boards. For moisture-sensitive LEDs, we strongly suggest customers contact us to bake the parts after placing orders.`,
        tip426: `11. SMT is a complicated production process. When the product is slightly damaged due to production, transportation, and some invisible factors, we sincerely hope that customers can try their best to help with repairing. PCBSUPER will also provide reasonable compensation for the faulty part (usually in excess of what we charge), but please understand that the compensation would not cover the cost of the entire board.`,
        tip427: `12. Consigned components will not be tested regarding quality or function before or after PCBA production. PCBSUPER is not responsible for any inevitable PCBA quality issues due to the quality problems of consigned components.`,
        tip428: `13. In order to standardize QC process and improve quality assurance, there will be some symbols automatically added on the edge rails for internal check. If customers have some special requirement on the edge rails, please take it into account when designing. PCBSUPER will not take the final responsibility.`,
        tip429: `5. Quality Complaint`,
        tip430: `If you have any objection to the quality of our assembly products, you need to submit a complaint in our system within three months from the date of receipt. If you do not raise a complaint within the time limit, it will be deemed that you have fully accepted the products provided by us, and the quality of the products fully meets your needs. Besides, if there is indeed some soldering defect, after verification, we will compensate based on the soldering fee we charge.`,

        tip454: `2. Calculation rules:`,
        tip455: `The thickness of the PI stiffener for gold fingers is not simply the connector thickness minus the FPC thickness; it needs to consider the impact of coverlay and copper thickness. The rules are as follows:`,
        tip456: `(1) If gold fingers have copper on the back: Subtract one layer of coverlay thickness (since gold fingers do not have cover film, this thickness needs to be subtracted).`,
        tip457: `(2) If gold fingers have no copper on the back: Subtract one layer of coverlay thickness and then subtract one layer of copper thickness (as gold fingers have no copper on the back, this additional copper layer needs to be subtracted).`,
        tip458: `For example:`,
        tip459: `if the total thickness in the gold finger area is 0.3 mm, the board thickness is 0.11 mm, and there is no copper on the back of the gold fingers, the theoretical thickness of the PI stiffener would be calculated as follows`,
        tip460: `PI Thickness = 0.3 - (0.11 - 0.0275 - 0.012) = 0.2295 mm. In this case, you should choose a PI thickness of 0.25 mm.`,

        tip1: `FPC forming tolerance refers to the precision tolerance of the board cutting, not the length and width tolerance of the board size, FPC because it is relatively thin, and is made of PI material, there are many processes in production that require high temperature and high pressure, there will be expansion and contraction, and the actual size of the FPC physical board needs to be measured before opening the steel mesh or fixture to change the steel mesh data and then make the steel mesh and fixture.`,
        tip2: `The copper weight on the inner layers for multilayer PCBs. The default inner copper weight is 0.5 oz.`,
        tip3: `Electro-Deposited (ED) copper is more brittle, while Rolled Anneale (RA) copper is more flexible. As a result, RA copper is better for bendable PCBs. ED copper can be deposited in thinner layers than RA copper, which can be beneficial in applications where thinner traces are required, and electrodeposited copper is less expensive.`,
